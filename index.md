I'm Tian Yafu, Phd Candidate of State Key Laboratory of Robotics and
System, Harbin Institute of Technology. Here's my resume: [ [My resume on website] ]({{ site.url }}/2017/11/06/resume.html),  [ [pdf version] ]({{ site.url }}/Resources/global/template.pdf)

For more tutorial, project introduction and useful tools I've written. please check out [my blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/yafu-blog?author=tian-ya-fu) (chinese). Like or suscribe it if you like :) Leaving a message if you want to contact to me, I'll check it out.

My life goal is to implement science fiction vision of advanced artificial intelligence.
And I devote myself to any research field which will help. A more actual goal is to
make robot learning and recognizing environment automatically. In past few years I
focused on state estimation and environment recognition problem of different robots
(Aeromodel, AGV and AUV). Now I'm working on with semantic object partition and recognition.

I've also in charge of two robot project (XiaoBai and XiaoHuang robot's software system). Those patrol robot is designed for area control, monitoring, and medical sterilize (XiaoBai robot).
