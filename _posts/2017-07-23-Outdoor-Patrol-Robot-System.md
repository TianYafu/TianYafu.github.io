title: [Project] Outdoor Patrol Robot (XiaoHuang) Software System
---

XiaoHuang is a patrol robot which is designed to adapt outdoor environment. Equipped with powerful security canera (from Hikvision), SICK laser scanner and other sensor, the robot can cope with common outdoor environment.

 
As this robot's sensor and driver is similar to XiaoBai Robot, I transplant XiaoBai's software system to this robot with slightly modified. After I finish reconstructing XiaoBai Robot's software system (v2, or even v3). I will reconstruct this robot's software system. 
Next task of this robot will be focused on autopilot ability and robustness.
